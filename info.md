:bar_chart: Data credits: [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/) / [StatsBomb](https://statsbomb.com/). All units per 90.

_**Outfield players dataset**_ - Total number of players : **2040**. Features for each player : **164**. Minimum 90s played : **3**.

_**Goal-keepers dataset**_ - Total number of players : **173**. Features for each player : **40**. Minimum 90s played : **1.5**.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: :bulb: **Note:** The similarity values are strictly based on the **statistical output of players**, in this case 40 statistical features for GK's and 164 features for outfield players. The similarity values are not probabilities but resemble more to percentiles (cosine distances normalized to the range 1 to 100).

:snake: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for dimensionality reduction. The detailed blog's link will be posted here soon covering data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and approach used for building the recommendation engine.
